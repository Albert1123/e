# e

Braindead editor. Feels like Vim, only simpler.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/hellerve/e
cd e
make install
```

## Usage

There are two major modes, `init` and `edit`. `edit` mode works like a normal
text editor would. `init` mode enables the user to navigate and do meta work,
such as saving the file, searching, and replacing.
